# Pythia-Vocal-Synth
with the sudden surge of Vocal Synths in the last few years I noticed i wasnt able to use ANY at school, but i was able to use Python, so i created my own using python. Just like UTAU

You can use this at school, as long as your school allows for python (Which most do) 

Requirements:
Python
PyQt6
Mido

that's all for now
