# Pythia-Vocal-Synth
with the sudden surge of Vocal Synths in the last few years I noticed i wasnt able to use ANY at school, but i was able to use Python, so i created my own using python. Just like UTAU you can make your own Pythia singer using a .Json's and .Wav's copy the default, change the Wav's and name of your voicebank (Open the Json in notepad)

You can use this at school, as long as your school allows for python (Which most do) 

Requirements:
Python
PyQt6

that's all for now
